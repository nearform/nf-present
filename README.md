# remark-styles

This module contains the stylesheets for remark training decks. Styles are written in Stylus, and are compiled when you install it. Styles have been carried over from old Deck styles, but some missing rules might break certain decks when migrating to remark (WIP).

## Installation

You shouldn't have to install this module manually, use https://github.com/nearform/remark-boilerplate for new decks.

If you're migrating a Deck presentation, use `npm install @nearform/remark-styles` to install and compile the CSS, and see `index.html` in the above repository for guidance.
