# remark-bootstrap

This module provides a command to serve nearForm training decks written using Remark.

## Installation

    npm install -g @nearform/remark-bootstrap

## Usage

See https://github.com/nearform/remark-boilerplate for a full example.

Using `nf-present` will start a server where you can access the slide deck. Install a skin in your slide deck to change the look/feel (you probably want `@nearform/remark-skin`).
